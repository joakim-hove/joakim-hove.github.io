Eclipse - or not
================

In the very first versions of ERT it was all about running Eclipse, there was no
general forward model. The concept of general forward model came quite quickly
and since then the special treatment of Eclipse has gradually been reduced. It
is now possible to run a forward model without Eclipse at all, but ERT is still
quite far from a situation where Eclipse is just any other forward model. For
good and for bad there is quite a lot of functionality in ERT which is
specifically targeted at Eclipse, this means that configuration will be
simpler - better error messages and so on.

Eclipse keywords
----------------

``DATA_FILE``
  This is the name of ECLIPSE data file used to control the simulations. The
  datafile used with this keyword should be prepared for use with ERT, and will
  generally not be a 100% valid ECLIPSE data file:

	::

		-- Load the data file called ECLIPSE.DATA
		DATA_FILE ECLIPSE.DATA

  When actually running the simulations ....  

``ECLBASE``
  This is the name of the simulations ....

``GRID``
  This should be the name of an existing GRID/EGRID file. The main use of the
  grid is to map out active and inactive cells when using ``FIELD`` data. If you
  do not use ``FIELD`` data you do not need the ``GRID`` keyword.
