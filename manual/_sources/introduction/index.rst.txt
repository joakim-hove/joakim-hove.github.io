Introduction to ERT and Ensemble based methods
==============================================

The reservoir model for a green field is based on a range subsurface input
including seismic data, a geological concept, well logs and fluid samples. All
of this data is uncertain, and it is quite obvious that the resulting reservoir
model is quite uncertain. Although uncertain reservoir models are still the only
tool we have when we make reservoir management decisions for the future.

Since reservoir models are very important for future predictions there is much
focus on reducing the uncertainty in the models. When the field has been in
production for some time one can use true data assembled from the producing
field to update the model. This process is commonly called *history matching* in
the petroleum industry, in this manual we will use the term "model updating*.
Before the model updating process can start you will need:

1. Observation data from the producing field :math:`d`. 
2. A reservoir model which has been *parameterized* with a parameter set :math:`\{\lambda\}`. 

Then the the actual model updating goes like this:

1. Simulate the behaviour of the field and assemble simulated data :math:`s`. 
2. Compare the simulated simulated data :math:`s` with the observed data :math:`d`. 
3. Based on the misfit between :math:`s` and :math:`d` updated parameters are
   :math:`\{\lambda'\}` are calculated.   

Model updating falls into the general category of *inverse problems* - i.e. we
know the results and want to determine the input parameters which gave rise to
these results.


It is very important to remember that the sole reason for doing model updating
is to be able to make better predictions for the future, the history has
happened already anyway!
